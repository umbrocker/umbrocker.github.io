- What are the advantages of the Zonal Architecture?
	- Determines connectivity by physical location rather than function
	- Reduces the number of ECUs, removes ~1km of harness cabling
	- Decouples hardware and software, providing a service-oriented architecture (SOA)
- How does (high-speed) CAN operate on the physical layer?
	- Linear bus terminated at each end with 120 Œ© resistors
	- Max. 1 Mbps
	- 2 wires: CAN High (CANH), CAN Low (CANL)
	- Two signal states (differential signaling)
		- Dominant (‚Äû0‚Äù): CANH is driven towards 3.5V, CANL is driven towards 1.5V
			- the signals are ‚Äûpulled‚Äù away from each other (differential voltage is a nominal ~2V)
		- Recessive (‚Äû1‚Äù): CANH and CANL are returned to recessive state
			- with a nominal differential voltage of 0V
- How does a Standard CAN Data Frame look like?
	- Identifier (Address): 11 bit
	- Data Field: max. 8 bytes

		- ![can_fd.png](./can_fd.png)
- How does the arbitration work regarding CAN?
	- Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CD)
	- All nodes must wait for an idle bus condition (before beginning to transmit a frame)
	- If two nodes begin to transmit a frame simultaneously, then they participate in a bitwise bus arbitration process
		- Wired-AND Logic
	- The node with the lowest ID wins the arbitration and continues to transmit its message
	- The other nodes lose the arbitration, back off and try later	
- What does it mean that ‚ÄúCAN was designed without security in mind‚Äù?
	- We can see all frames on the bus
	- We don‚Äôt know which node transmitted a given frame
	- We don‚Äôt know if the frame was altered on the bus or not
	- We are ‚Äûfree‚Äù to transmit arbitrary frames on the bus
- How would you perform a Denial-of-Service attack on a CAN bus?
	- The attacker sends high priority frames with a high speed (e.g., ID = 0x00)
	- The other nodes will not have a chance to win arbitration
- What common attacks can an attacker perform on a CAN network?
	- inject frames
	- manipulate frames
	- replay frames
	- ddos the bus
	- Drive a node to a ‚Äûbus off‚Äù state

	- PDU (Protocol Data Unit) Integrity + Authenticity: MAC or Signature
	- PDU Freshness: Protection against replay attacks with counter or freshness value
- Where would you place firewalls on a CAN bus?
	- Between segments on gateways
	- Between interfaces and the bus
- What tools would you use to monitor/analyze a CAN network?
	- Vector CANoe
